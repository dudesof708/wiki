This is the Dudes of 708 wiki page on how to set up your **development environment**. If you're an experienced developer, jump to [Quickstart](#quickstart), and if you're new to programming, jump to [Long Instructions](#long-instructions). **Once you're ready, check out [resources on learning](learn)!**

## Quickstart

1. Install [Unity](https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual). The **student** version is automatically free with GitHub Pro for Students.
2. Clone the relevant game repositories to your computer using Git.
3. Check the project boards to see what's left to do, and help out with that.

## Long Instructions

1. Create a GitHub account. If you're reading this page, you most likely already have a GitHub account and you're in the [Dudes of 708](https://github.com/dudesof708) team. If that is the case, skip over to step 2. Otherwise, here's how to set up Git and GitHub:

    1. At [this GitHub page](https://github.com/join), create a GitHub account.
    2. We use GitHub to collaborate, so to make things simple, I reccomend downloading [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Set that up as well.
    3. After logging in, message the [Discord](https://discord.gg/WUGMTcZ) with your username so you can be added as a project collaborator. You should see private repositories show up in GitHub Desktop when you click on **Clone Repository** in the File menu, like so:

    4. Find the games (or other relevant) repositories, and clone them to your computer with the **Clone** button.
    5. You'll now be able to open this project in your IDE of choice (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) if you're doing development in C#, or Unity if you're doing development in Unity.

2. Head over the [Unity website](https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual) and select an indvidual download plan to download Unity.
3. Both individual versions are free, but I highly reccomend getting the **Student** plan if it is available to you. If you choose to get the Student plan, you'll need to make a Unity account and connect it to an account with GitHub Pro. Follow [this link](https://education.github.com/pack) to get GitHub Pro for Students. Otherwise, pick **Personal**.

4. Follow the on-screen steps to install Unity. You should end up at the Unity start-up screen known as **Unity Hub** after signing in and following all the steps. If you clicked on the tutorial, you can follow that instead, then come back to Unity Hub.

5. When looking at the Unity Hub screen, you can open the project folder you downloaded in step **1.4** in order to open the project in Unity.

For instructions on getting started with Unity, follow online tutorials.
