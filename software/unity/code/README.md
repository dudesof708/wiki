# Setting Up IDEs

An **IDE** is an Integrated Development Environment. You can think of Unity as an IDE for developing the game objects, assets, and the world itself. But what about the code that powers the game? Unity uses a programming language called **C#** to power its scripts, and this requires something known as the **.NET Framework** from Microsoft. This guide will walk you through setting up everything.

## Quickstart

If you're an experienced developer, follow the quickstart. Otherwise, jump down to [Installation](#installation) to follow a more detailed guide with screenshots.

1. Get a text editor of your choice. I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you also use VS Code, install the [C# Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp).
2. Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/sdk-for-vs-code), and refresh your PATH.

## Installation

1. You'll need a text editor of your choice. I reccommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as it has a lot of powerful features, like [linting](../../../glossary#l), [IntelliSense](../../../glossary#i), and more.
2. Now you'll need a .NET Framework SDK. Download the [.NET Core SDK for VS Code](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/sdk-for-vs-code) or the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) if you chose another code editor.
3. If you chose to go with VS Code, I reccommend installing the [C# Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) so you get support in your code editor for all of its fancy features.
4. Reboot your computer.
