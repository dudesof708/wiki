## Android

### Android Preparation

This guide assumes you meet the following requirements:

* You are running Android 5.0+
* [Discord](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord) is installed and logged into your main account
* A file manager is installed (although it should come with most Android devices, if you don't have one, I highly reccommend [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2))

### Android Installation Guide

1. Open Discord, and find the Dudes of 708 Discord server. Navigate to the private channel **#708-projects** and check pinned for the latest ChompChomp build. Find a message with an attachment that ends in `.ipa`. Download this file to your device.
2. Open your file browser, then tap on the `.ipa` file you just downloaded. Select a package manager if prompted.
   * Note: you may get a security warning. You'll have to follow the steps to "**Allow unknown apps**" as this app is being downloaded from somewhere outside the Play Store.
3. A screen should come up asking you to install the app. Tap **Install**.

## iOS

### iOS Preparation

This guide assumes you meet the following requirements:

* You are running iOS 10+
* You have the Discord app installed on your iOS device with your main account logged in.
* You have admin access to a macOS or Windows device with unfiltered network access to the same network your iOS device is on.
* The latest versions of iTunes and iCloud are installed on your computer.

### iOS Installation Guide

1. On your computer, head to [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) and download the macOS or Windows version corresponding to your computer.
2. Unzip the downloaded file, and run the program.
   * For macOS, you have the optional installation step of copying the file your Applications folder. This step is not necessary.
   * For Windows, the program you launched is actually a setup file and you will have to install AltStore to your computer.
3. If AltStore isn't launched, launch it now.
4. Connect your iOS device to your computer and unlock it.
   * If you have issues connecting your device, try to use an official Apple cable with USB-A 2.0.
   * If prompted, you may need to provide your password and trust the computer you just connected.
5. Open iTunes and go to the sync tab for your device, and enable syncing over WiFi.
   * For certain macOS devices, you may need to open Finder and enable the option for showing the device on WiFi.
6. Click the AltServer logo on your notification bar (both macOS and Windows) and find your device, then click **Install AltStore**.
7. Provide your Apple ID email and password.
   * If you have a developer account, use this, as it will keep your app active for 1 year instead of 7 days. You can obtain one from Apple for $99 a year.
   * If you are using macOS, you'll need to install a plug-in for the Mail app. Follow the on-screen instructions.
8. Open Discord, and find the Dudes of 708 server and find the private **#708-projects** channel. Check the pinned tab for the latest `.ipa` download of ChompChomp, and navigate to this message.
9. Download the message by tapping on the file, then tapping the more/share icon and saving the file to your Files app.
   * If you are using an older version that does not support the Files app, you may need to jailbreak. Contact the Discord channel for help.
10. Open AltStore on your iOS device, navigate to the My Apps tab, and press the + button.
11. Find the `.ipa` file in your Files app that you downloaded from Discord, and select it. ChompChomp should now be installed.
