This is the Dudes of 708 wiki page on how to set up your **development environment**.

1. Head over the [Unity website](https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual) and select an indvidual download plan to download Unity.
2. Both individual versions are free, but I highly reccomend getting the **Student** plan if it is available to you. If you choose to get the Student plan, you'll need to make a Unity account and connect it to an account with GitHub Pro. Follow [this link](https://education.github.com/pack) to get GitHub Pro for Students. Otherwise, pick **Personal**.

4. Develop
