## Dudes of 708 App Usage

The [wikipedia-speedrun](https://github.com/dudesof708/wikipedia-speedrun) Dudes of 708 app will allow you to generate two endpoints for which the entire group can then speedrun and try to get from start to finish. It has features like points tracking as well, so you can easily keep track of the score.

How to use it is coming soon, as well as a cheating feature (a required feature of *any* app).
