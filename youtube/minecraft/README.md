**Game goal: obtain the "Not quite nine lives" advancement, aka charge a Respawn Anchor to the max.**

1. Punch wood with hand, make wooden tools.
2. Obtain stone tools.
3. 2 people explore for better gear and [ruined portals](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ruined_Portal). 2 people mine for iron and gold. We don't really need diamonds except for a diamond pick.

   * We can expect about 0-2 crying obsidian per portal, upwards of 5.
   * Doesn't generate super frequently so the higher priority is going to the Nether.

4. We need 6 crying obsidian and 7 glowstone to create and fully charge a respawn anchor. Options:
   * Piglin Trading Farm - piglins drop at 8.71% chance.
   * Exploring
